I like technology, teaching, traveling, and granola. I have experience writing code in JavaScript, Python, Java, and Ruby. I've used various major development frameworks and with a bit of ramp up, can work on the front or back end of any application.

The biggest thing I look for in a job is the ability to have measurable, positive impact on users. The second thing I look for is a growth culture. It's really important to me that I'm able to constantly learn new tech and then use it in my day-to-day. I love working on hard problems as part of a team and getting to adapt and grow as a group.
