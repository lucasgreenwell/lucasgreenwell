Hi, I like technology, teaching, traveling, and granola. I have experience writing code in JavaScript, Python, Java, and Ruby. I've used various major development frameworks and with a bit of ramp up, can work on the front or back end of any application. My most recent obsession is learning how to implement existing machine learning solutions in my projects. The possibilities that Big Data has brought to developers are constantly exciting me!

The biggest thing I look for in a job is the ability to have measurable, positive impact on users. The second thing I look for is a growth culture. It's really important to me that I'm able to constantly learn new tech and then use it in my day-to-day. I love working on hard problems as part of a team and getting to adapt and grow as a group.
