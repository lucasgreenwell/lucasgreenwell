I like technology, teaching, traveling, and granola. Physically based out of Nicaragua, logistically based out of the internet. I'm a US citizen and willing to relocate for the right role. Currently learning new things at Lambda School as a full time Computer Science student and studying for my Cloud Engineer Certification.

<br/>
I'm currently looking for new opportunities in the tech industry. Ideally, I'd like to be in a software engineer or a data analyst position on a remote team that works in one-two week sprints. Whether I'm in a SWE role or an analyst role, having plenty of collaboration with the other role is a must-have for me. It's really important to me that I'm able to constantly learn new tech and then use it in my day-to-day. I love working on hard problems as part of a team and getting to adapt and grow as a group.

<br/>
I have experience writing code in JavaScript, Python, Java, and Ruby. I've used various major web development frameworks and with a bit of ramp up, can work on the front or back end of any web app. My most recent obsession is learning how to implement existing machine learning solutions in my projects. The possibilities that Big Data has brought to developers are constantly exciting me!
